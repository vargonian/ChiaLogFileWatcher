# ChiaLogFileWatcher
Watches Chia (or fork) log files for proofs and alerts the user when found.

Be sure to configure your [config.yaml](ChiaLogFileWatcher/config.yaml) to specify the log file paths to watch, and to customize your alert sound file if desired.  The [config.yaml](ChiaLogFileWatcher/config.yaml) must be in the same directory as the executable.

This should work on Linux, Windows, and MacOS but I've only tested on Windows so far.
